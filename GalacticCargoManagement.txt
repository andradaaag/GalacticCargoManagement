Build a Galactic Cargo Management console application 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functional requirements :

The application has no UI (just console interaction) 
and no database. Data will be loaded from the 3 JSON OR 
XML (whichever you prefer) files (planets, ships, 
characters).
Interaction with the user will be made via console 
input.

Each ship has a type, a maximum cargo weight in KG 
that it can transport, and the speed in KM/hour. 
Each planet is at different distance in KM from the 
current point.
Characters can only pilot the ships identified by 
the "shipsType" array.

At runtime, the user will be asked which 
driver/character he wants to use.
The user will then input a cargo weight and the 
destination planet.

The application, should list all the ships that can 
transport that cargo weight, the time it will take 
to transport the cargo, and how many trips the ship 
will have to make to transport the cargo.
Ships should be listed ordered, with the ship that 
will transport the cargo the fastest, first.

EG : for instance, Han Solo, can transport a cargo 
of 50.000KG to Jakku, in 60 hours, using the 
Millenium Falcon in 2 trips ( note, he will 
also have to return to the current location 
after finishing the first cargo delivery )

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-functional requirements : 

You can use any of the following languages Java, 
Kotlin, .NET.
You will either send your project sources via email 
in an ZIP archive or commit your sources under your 
GitHub account, and send the link to the project.
You must also submit a .JAR or .EXE file and the 
instructions on how to run the project if needed.

Points will be awarded for simplicity of usage of 
the application, correctness of solution, lack of bugs,
 usage of OOP practices and cleanness of the final 
 solution.
